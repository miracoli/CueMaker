# CueMaker

CueMaker scans the current (or a optionally given) directory and if it finds one .iso file creates a .cue file for it.
Futhermore if there are files ending with .wav, .wave, .flac or .mp3 in the same directory they are added as audio tracks.

The program is intended primarily for use with the tool chain of the Jo Sega Saturn Engine (jo-engine.org), but of course it can also be used separately.
